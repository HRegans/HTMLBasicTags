    <h1>Reasons to LOVE corgis</h1>
    <div class="wrapper">
        <h2>Three Reasons:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Ears:</strong> corgi's are known for their significantly large ears for their little bodies; a feature you can't help to love.</li>
            <li><strong>Smile:</strong> everyone likes to see a dog smile, but corgi's have such a distinctly adorable smile that's impossible to forget.</li>
            <li><strong>Legs:</strong> this is usually a corgi owner's favorite feature about their corgi. Corgi's grew their fame from their short stature, yet lengthy bodies.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Just incase you were having a bad day, here's a video of a corgi.</p>
